Project: Optimize Local Gallery Image Card Selection Performance
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2026-01-26

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Performance optimization of existing batch selection functionality. This is classified as 'feature' because it requires code changes to improve responsiveness without changing feature behavior.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created/upgraded project_index.json with Flutter/Dart tech stack details
- Created/upgraded context.json with comprehensive investigation findings
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 11
- Created init.sh

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 - Provider Toggle Method Optimization: 2 subtasks, depends on []
- Phase 2 - Implement Granular State Watching in UI: 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-provider-optimization]
- Phase 3 - Create Unit Tests: 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-provider-optimization]
- Phase 4 - Create Integration Tests: 1 subtask, depends on [phase-2-granular-state-watching]
- Phase 5 - Performance Verification and QA: 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2-granular-state-watching, phase-3-unit-tests, phase-4-integration-tests]

Services Involved:
- flutter_app: Local gallery selection performance optimization using Riverpod state management

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1 (sequential execution recommended for single-service optimization)
- Parallel groups:
  * Phase 3 (Unit Tests) and Phase 4 (Integration Tests) can potentially run in parallel after their dependencies complete

Investigation Findings:
=====================

Problem Identified:
- ~1 second delay between click and visual feedback when toggling image selection
- Root cause: All visible cards rebuild on every selection change
- Location: local_gallery_screen.dart lines 1420-1421 watches entire provider state
- Secondary issue: Set<String>.from() copies in selection_mode_provider.dart toggle method

Key Files to Modify:
1. lib/presentation/providers/selection_mode_provider.dart
   - Optimize toggle method (lines 117-125) to avoid Set copying
   - Optimize selectRange method (line 191) for batch operations
   - Methods to optimize: toggle, select, deselect, selectAll, enterAndSelect, selectRange

2. lib/presentation/screens/local_gallery/local_gallery_screen.dart
   - Replace global state watching with per-card selective watching
   - Current: ref.watch(localGallerySelectionNotifierProvider)
   - Optimized: ref.watch(localGallerySelectionNotifierProvider.select((state) => state.selectedIds.contains(record.path)))

Tech Stack:
- Flutter 3.x
- Dart 3.2+
- Riverpod 2.5.1 (flutter_riverpod)
- State management: Provider with code generation (@riverpod annotation)
- Testing: flutter_test, mocktail, integration_test

Existing Patterns:
- Riverpod providers with ref.watch() pattern throughout codebase
- No existing use of .select() feature - this will be first implementation
- MasonryGridView.count with itemBuilder (already optimized builder pattern)
- LocalImageCard as StatefulWidget receiving isSelected as prop

Optimization Strategy:
1. Use Riverpod's select() for granular state watching per card
2. Optimize toggle method to avoid unnecessary Set copying
3. Ensure only clicked card rebuilds, not all visible cards
4. Add performance measurement logging

Performance Targets:
- Current: ~1000ms (1 second)
- Target: <50ms (imperceptible to human perception)
- Expected Improvement: 20x faster
- Must support 100+ selections without degradation

To continue building this spec, run:

  flutter run -d windows --profile

=== END SESSION 1 ===

=== START SESSION 2 (Coder) ===

Subtask 1-1: Optimize toggle method to avoid Set copying
Status: COMPLETED

Implementation:
- File: lib/presentation/providers/selection_mode_provider.dart
- Modified OnlineGallerySelectionNotifier.toggle() method (lines 55-61)
- Modified LocalGallerySelectionNotifier.toggle() method (lines 113-119)
- Replaced Set<String>.from() copying with immutable Set operations
- Used .difference({id}) for removal and .union({id}) for addition

Optimization Details:
Before: Created full copy of Set with Set<String>.from(state.selectedIds) - O(n)
After: Use .difference() and .union() operations - O(1) for the operation
Benefits: Reduces memory allocation and CPU overhead, especially with large selections

Code Changes:
```dart
// Before:
final newIds = Set<String>.from(state.selectedIds);
if (newIds.contains(id)) {
  newIds.remove(id);
} else {
  newIds.add(id);
}
state = state.copyWith(selectedIds: newIds);

// After:
final newIds = state.selectedIds.contains(id)
    ? state.selectedIds.difference({id})
    : state.selectedIds.union({id});
state = state.copyWith(selectedIds: newIds);
```

Verification:
- Generated provider code with build_runner (successful)
- Ran flutter analyze - no issues found
- Code compiles successfully
- Test file not yet created (subtask-3-1)
- Unit tests will be created in Phase 3

- Lines changed: 6 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-)

Notes:
- Followed code patterns from existing file
- No console.log/print statements added
- No breaking changes to API
- Methods maintain identical behavior, just more efficient

=== START SESSION 3 (Coder) ===

Subtask 1-2: Optimize selectRange method for batch operations
Status: COMPLETED

Implementation:
- File: lib/presentation/providers/selection_mode_provider.dart
- Modified OnlineGallerySelectionNotifier.selectRange() method (lines 79-82)
- Modified LocalGallerySelectionNotifier.selectRange() method (lines 137-140)
- Replaced Set.from().addAll() with spread operator for cleaner immutable operations

Optimization Details:
Before: Set.from(state.selectedIds) then addAll(rangeIds) - O(n+m) + creates copy
After: {...state.selectedIds, ...rangeIds} spread operator - O(n+m) but more idiomatic
Benefits: Cleaner code, same performance characteristics, uses modern Dart idioms

Code Changes:
```dart
// Before:
final newIds = Set<String>.from(state.selectedIds);
newIds.addAll(rangeIds);
state = state.copyWith(selectedIds: newIds);

// After:
state = state.copyWith(selectedIds: {...state.selectedIds, ...rangeIds});
```

Verification:
- Regenerated provider code with build_runner (successful)
- Ran flutter analyze - no issues found
- Code compiles successfully
- Unit tests will be created in Phase 3

Commit:
- Hash: 6a5b8d2
- Message: "auto-claude: subtask-1-2 - Optimize selectRange method using spread operator"
- Files changed: lib/presentation/providers/selection_mode_provider.dart
- Lines changed: 4 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)

Notes:
- Spread operator is modern Dart idiom for combining Sets
- Maintains immutability while being more readable
- Performance equivalent to previous approach but cleaner code

Subtask 2-1: Replace ref.watch with ref.watch().select() in MasonryGridView itemBuilder
Status: COMPLETED

Implementation:
- File: lib/presentation/screens/local_gallery/local_gallery_screen.dart
- Modified MasonryGridView.count itemBuilder (lines 1420-1423)
- Replaced full state watch with granular .select() calls

Optimization Details:
Before: ref.watch(localGallerySelectionNotifierProvider) - watches entire state
After: Two granular watches:
  1. ref.watch().select((state) => state.selectedIds.contains(record.path))
  2. ref.watch().select((state) => state.isActive)
Benefits: Each card only rebuilds when its specific selection state changes

Code Changes:
```dart
// Before:
final selectionState = ref.watch(localGallerySelectionNotifierProvider);
final isSelected = selectionState.selectedIds.contains(record.path);

// After:
final isSelected = ref.watch(localGallerySelectionNotifierProvider
    .select((state) => state.selectedIds.contains(record.path)));
final selectionMode = ref.watch(localGallerySelectionNotifierProvider
    .select((state) => state.isActive));
```

Verification:
- Manual verification required with Flutter DevTools (pending)
- Expected: Only clicked card rebuilds, not all visible cards
- Code compiles successfully
- No breaking changes

Commit:
- Hash: e0da494
- Message: "auto-claude: subtask-2-1 - Replace ref.watch with ref.watch().select() in MasonryGridView itemBuilder"
- Files changed: lib/presentation/screens/local_gallery/local_gallery_screen.dart
- Lines changed: 6 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)

Notes:
- This is the core performance optimization for the UI
- Uses Riverpod's select() feature for granular state watching
- Each card now only depends on its specific selection state
- Should reduce rebuilds from all visible cards to just the clicked card
- First use of .select() in the codebase
