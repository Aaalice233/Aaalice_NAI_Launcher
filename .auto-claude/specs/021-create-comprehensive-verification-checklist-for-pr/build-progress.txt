=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: AI-Assisted Verification System for BUG Fixes & Improvements
Workspace: E:\Aaalice_NAI_Launcher
Started: 2026-01-26 10:56:00 UTC

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: New test infrastructure and verification framework being added (not a refactor or bug fix)

Session 1 (Planner):
- ✅ Created implementation_plan.json
- ✅ Updated context.json with patterns and tech stack
- ✅ Updated project_index.json with service definitions
- ✅ Created init.sh environment setup script
- Phases: 7
- Total subtasks: 34

=== PHASE BREAKDOWN ===

Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup (3 subtasks)
- Create test directories and fixture structure
- Create test fixture data files (images, JSON mocks)
- Verify mocktail and integration_test dependencies
- Depends on: None
- Parallel: Yes

Phase 2: Automated BUG Test Cases (9 subtasks)
- BUG-001: Vibe encoding zero-point consumption test
- BUG-002: DDIM sampler validation test
- BUG-003: Seed persistence test
- BUG-004/005: Authentication API tests (Danbooru/Gallery)
- BUG-006: Sidebar width state persistence test
- BUG-007: Search query parsing test (underscores)
- BUG-008: Prompt autofill click-to-insert widget test
- BUG-009: Character bar UI component test
- Run all BUG tests and verify >90% pass rate
- Depends on: Phase 1
- Parallel: Yes

Phase 3: Manual Verification Documentation (4 subtasks)
- Create manual verification document
- Document UI layout verification (IMPR-001~004)
- Document workflow verification (IMPR-006~008, IMPR-012)
- Document performance and feature flag verification
- Depends on: Phase 1
- Parallel: Yes (can run with Phase 2)

Phase 4: Test Result Processor Tool (3 subtasks)
- Create test result processor Dart CLI tool
- Parse Flutter test JSON output
- Generate structured JSON for dashboard
- Depends on: Phase 2
- Parallel: No

Phase 5: Verification Dashboard (6 subtasks)
- Create HTML dashboard structure
- Add CSS styling for PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED visualization
- Add JavaScript for test result loading
- Implement evidence collection display
- Implement regression detection
- Add coverage report display
- Depends on: Phase 4
- Parallel: No

Phase 6: CI/CD Pipeline Integration (4 subtasks)
- Create GitHub Actions workflow YAML
- Configure for Windows and Flutter
- Add test result upload as artifacts
- Add PR comment with test results summary
- Depends on: Phase 5
- Parallel: No

Phase 7: End-to-End Integration Testing (5 subtasks)
- Run full test suite and generate dashboard
- Verify manual verification document completeness
- Verify test execution time <10 minutes
- Verify no regressions in existing tests
- Verify dashboard regression detection works
- Depends on: Phases 2, 3, 5, 6
- Parallel: No

=== SERVICES INVOLVED ===

1. nai_launcher (System Under Test)
   - Tech Stack: Flutter, Dart, Riverpod, Hive, Dio
   - Role: Application being tested
   - Files: 9 test files for BUGs, manual verification doc

2. verification_tool (Test Result Processor)
   - Tech Stack: Dart CLI
   - Role: Parse Flutter test output and generate JSON
   - Files: tool/test_result_processor.dart

3. dashboard (Verification Dashboard)
   - Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Role: Display test results and evidence
   - Files: test_results/dashboard/

=== PARALLELISM ANALYSIS ===

Max Parallel Phases: 2
Parallel Groups:
  - Phase 2 (Automated BUG Tests) + Phase 3 (Manual Verification)
    Reason: Both depend only on Phase 1, work on different file sets
Recommended Workers: 1 (conservative - phase dependencies are mostly sequential)
Speedup Estimate: 1.2x faster than sequential

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: HIGH
Validation Required: unit, integration, e2e
Security Scan: Yes (tests handle auth credentials)
Staging Deployment: No (test infrastructure only)

Acceptance Criteria:
  ✓ All 9 BUG automated tests exist and pass with >90% success rate
  ✓ All 16 improvements have documented manual verification steps
  ✓ Verification dashboard displays clear PASS/FAIL visualization
  ✓ Evidence collection (screenshots, logs) is automated and accessible
  ✓ Regression detection compares current vs previous test runs
  ✓ Full verification run completes in <10 minutes
  ✓ No regressions in existing functionality
  ✓ Code follows established patterns (AAA, descriptive reasons)

=== KEY PATTERNS DISCOVERED ===

From Codebase Investigation:
- Test Structure: group() → test() with Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Mocking: Use Mocktail (not mockito): class MockX extends Mock implements X
- Widget Tests: testWidgets() → pumpWidget() → actions → pumpAndSettle() → assertions
- Integration Tests: Initialize Hive in setUp() with test directory
- Logging: Use AppLogger.d/i/w/e() with test name tags for evidence

Reference Files:
- test/data/models/prompt/tag_favorite_test.dart (AAA pattern with descriptive reasons)
- test/integration/favorites_storage_test.dart (Hive initialization and cleanup)
- lib/core/utils/app_logger.dart (logging utilities)
- tool/extract_metadata.dart (Dart CLI tool pattern)

      * Structured JSON Output:
        - Generates nested JSON structure:
          - summary: Overall statistics (total, passed, failed, skipped, passRate, success, timestamp)
          - testFiles: List of all test files processed
          - resultsByFile: Test results grouped by file with per-file statistics
          - errors: Detailed error information for failed tests (error message, stack trace)
      * Console Output:
        - Displays Chinese language summary
        - Shows test counts, pass rate, and PASS/FAIL status
        - Groups results by test file with per-file statistics
        - Lists failed tests with error messages
